##QT
*From wikipedia*
Qt (/ˈkjuːt/ "cute", or unofficially as Q-T cue-tee) is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase, while having the power and speed of native applications. Qt is currently being developed both by the Qt Company, a subsidiary of Digia, and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and firms working to advance Qt.[11][12][13] Digia owns the Qt trademark and copyright. Qt is available with both commercial[4] and open source[14] GPL v3, LGPL v3[7] and LGPL v2 licenses.

Using QT allows QTGSM to be available on any platform including mobile and tablet. While this is not currently the case, using QT gives us this option in the future.
